# Known bugs

Defects that are understood but not yet fixed. Each entry gives the
affected code, the trigger, and the wrong behavior.

## `tests/run_tests.sh` never runs in CI

Affects `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

The `macos` job's "Install Python simulator packages (py65, z80-python)"
step has a comment saying "`make test` (below) drives real, independent
CPU cores for the 6502/65c02 (py65) and 8080/z80 (z80-python) targets",
but no job invokes `make test` or `tests/run_tests.sh` anywhere in the
workflow, so that suite - and the py65/z80-python packages installed for
it - never actually run in CI.
